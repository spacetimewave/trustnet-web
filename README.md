This project is a React template designed to accelerate web development. The primary goal is to enable developers to bring their ideas to the market as quickly as possible, with an integrated go to market strategy.

React Template empowers developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces, built with a focus on declarative programming, component-based architecture, and versatility.

## Features

Version 0.1.0 of the project, released on February 16, 2024, introduces a robust set of features designed to streamline the development and maintenance of a React-based web application.

At the core of this project is the integration of Vite and esbuild as the chosen build tools. This choice aims to enhance development experience and build times. The project is developed in JavaScript, although in future versions a typescript project willbe included as well.

The project includes basic page templates to establish a clear and organized page hierarchy. The integration of routing enables a seamless navigation within the application.

Also a component library of reusable components has been included, contributing to modular and maintainable code. This approach not only accelerates development speed but also ensures consistency throughout the application.

The template includes authentication and protected routes adding a layer of security and control over the application.

Global state management has been implemented using Preact Signals. Signal enhance data management and sharing across components, contributing to a more efficient and scalable architecture. Signals also improve DX because they are easy to configure.

The project also includes service modules for external interactions, facilitating communication with APIs and external data sources.

Environment configurations for development, user acceptance testing, and production environments are set up, enabling seamless transitions between different deployment stages.

The project adopts CSS Modules for structured, isolated, and modular styling. This approach prevents style conflicts and enhances maintainability by encapsulating styles within individual components.

To maintain code quality, the project incorporates tools such as ESLint for code consistency and Prettier for consistent code formatting. These tools enforce coding standards and contribute to a clean and readable codebase.

   $ npm install standard -D
   ```

2. Install VSCode extension: ESLint by Microsoft.

3. Initialize the linter, its configuration, and install its dependencies.

   ```

   ```console
    $ npx eslint --init # Option 1
    $ npm init @eslint/config # Option 2

    √ Which package manager do you want to use? · npm
    Installing eslint-plugin-react@latest, eslint-config-standard@latest, eslint@^8.0.1, eslint-plugin-import@^2.25.2, eslint-plugin-n@^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0 , eslint-plugin-promise@^6.0.0
   ```

4. Change the configuration: .eslintrc.json

5. Show linting errors.

   ```console
   $ npx eslint .
   $ npx eslint src
   ```

6. Fix linting errors

   ```console
   $ npx eslint . --fix
   $ npx eslint src --fix
   ```

7. Install prettier as a development dependency.

   ```console
   $ npm install prettier -D
   ```

8. Install VSCode extension: Prettier by Prettier

9. Create Prettier config: .prettierrc.json

10. Format code with Prettier (show the changes to be made).

    ```console
    $ npx prettier .
    $ npx prettier src
    ```

11. Format code with Prettier (apply changes).

    ```console
    $ npx prettier . --write
    $ npx prettier src --write
    ```

12. Add to VSCode "Format Document With..." > "Configure Default Formatter.. " > "Prettier"

13. Add to VSCode "Settings" > "Format On Save" and "Format On Save Mode" > "file"

14. Prioritize Prettier rules over ESLint rules.

    Install "eslint-config-prettier" plugin.

    ```console
    $ npm install eslint-config-prettier -D
    ```

    Add to "extends" object in .eslintrc.json "eslint-config-prettier".

    ```console
    dist
    package-lock.json
    node_modules
    ```

    dist
    node_modules
    ```

17. Add commands to "scripts" object in "package.json".

    ```console
    "format": "prettier --write ."

    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
        react(),
        checker({
          eslint: {
            lintCommand: 'eslint "./src/**/*.{js,jsx}"',
